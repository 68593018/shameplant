Dear Gary,  

Hope you are doing well.  

I'm doing fine, though my life is quite hectic at the moment because, as you know, I am moving abroad and there is so much to do!  

There are a few things that I can't take with me because they are too big so I am seeking if any of my friends would be interested in 
buying them. One of the things I do not want to take with me is my television, and I thought you might like to buy it off me for a cheap
price.  

It's a 32" flat screen TV, and it's a Phillips model. It has a USB port so you can just plug in a thumb dirve to watch movies or listen to
music. It has great stero surround sound.

As you know, I'm leaving the country at the end of the month, which is only two weeks away. So if you want to see it, it would be best to
come on 20th or 21st. That will give me time to sell it elsewhere if you are not interested.

Ok, I look forward to seeing you. Let me know if you can't make it.

All the best, John.
