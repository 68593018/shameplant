- Answer

Dear Gary,  

Hope you are doing well.  

I'm doing fine, though my life is quite hectic at the moment because, as you know, I am moving abroad and there is so much to do!  

There are a few things that I can't take with me because they are too big so I am seeking if any of my friends would be interested in 
buying them. One of the things I do not want to take with me is my television, and I thought you might like to buy it off me for a cheap
price.  

It's a 32" flat screen TV, and it's a Phillips model. It has a USB port so you can just plug in a thumb dirve to watch movies or listen to
music. It has great stero surround sound.

As you know, I'm leaving the country at the end of the month, which is only two weeks away. So if you want to see it, it would be best to
come on 20th or 21st. That will give me time to sell it elsewhere if you are not interested.

Ok, I look forward to seeing you. Let me know if you can't make it.

All the best, John.

## Semi-formal

- Question

You are experencing financial probleams and want to ask you landlord if you pay your rent late. Write a letter to your landlord

In your letter explain:  

Why you are writing to him  
Why you cannot pay the rent  
When you will pay the rent  

- Answer

Dear Mr StickLand,  

I am writing to you to request that you allow me to pay my rent late this month. 

I've been a tenant with you for a number of years now, and, as you know, I have always paid my rent on time. However, I am having a few 
financial problems at the moment. Last month, I was made redundant from my job because the company I work for is closing down. Because I 
have not worked at the company for long, I have not received a redundancy payment, therefore leaving me short of money this month.

I can assure you that I will be able to pay the rent on the 15th of next month. I have now found another job, and they have kindly 
agreed to give me an advance on my wages, but they are unable to arrange this until next week. 

I hope this will be acceptable to you, but please contact me if it is a problem.

Yours sincerely,  
John Streetham.
