## Essay 1: Agree/Disagree

- Question

Currently there is a trend towards the use of alternative forms of medicine. However, at best these methods are in ineffective, and at worst they may be dangerous

To what extent do you agree with this statement?

- Answer

Alternative medicine is not new. It is accepted that it pre-dates conventional medicine and it is still used by many people all over the
world. I am unconvinced that it is dangerous, and feel that both alternative and convintional medicine can be useful.

There are several reasons why the conventional medical community is often dismissive of alternatives. Firstly, there has been little 
scientific research into such medicine, so there is a scarcity of evidence to support the claims of their supporters. Furthermore,
people often try such treatment because of recommendations from friends, and therefore come to the therapist with a very positive
attitude, which may be part of the reason for the cure. Moreover, these therapies are usually only useful for long-term, chronic
conditions, Acute medical problems, such as accidental injury, often require more conventional methods.

On the other hand, there remain strong arguments for the use of alternatives. Despite the lack of scientific proof, there is a lot of
anecdotal evidence to suggest that these therapies work. In addition, far from being dangerous, they often have few or no side effects,
so the worst outcome would be no change, One of the strongest arguments for the effectiveness of alternative therapies in the West is that
, whilst conventional medicine is available without charge, many people are prepared to pay considerable sums for alternatives. If they 
were totally unhelpful, it would be surprising if this continued.
