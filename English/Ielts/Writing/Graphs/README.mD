- Answer

The pie charts show the amount of revenue and expenditures over a year of a children's charity in the USA. Overall, it can be seen that 
donated food accounted for the majority of the income, while programe services accounted for the most expenditure. Total revenue sources
just exceeded outgoings.

In detail, donated food provided most of the revenue for the charity, at 86%. Similarly, with regard to expenditures, one category, 
program services, accounted for nearly all of the outgoings, at 95.8%.

The other categories were much smaller. Community contributions, which were the second largest revenue source, brought in 10.4% of overall
income, and this was followed by program revenue, at 2.2%. Investment income, goverment grant, and other income were very small sources of 
revenue, account for only 0.8% combined.

There were only two other expenditure items, fundrasing and management and general, accounting for 2.6% and 1.6% respectively. The total
amount of income was $53,5615,80, which was just enough to cover the expenditure of $53,224,896.
